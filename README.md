## Write On:
### 1. Helpful Python snippets for Image Processing using OpenCV
    For, Binary, Grayscale and RGB Images.
1. Basic I/0: Read,Show,Write Images
    - Image Represenation in OpenCV
2. Basic Operations:
    - ~~Convert~~
    - ~~Resize~~
    - ~~Flip~~
    - ~~Rotate~~
    - ~~Crop~~
3. Mathematical and Logical Operations on Images:
    - ~~Matrix Opeations~~
    - ~~Artihmatic Operations.~~
    - ~~Logical Operations.~~
4. Image Enhancement
    - ~~Log Transform~~
    - ~~Power-law(Gamma) transformations~~
    - ~~Contrast Stretching~~
    - ~~Histogram Processing~~
    - ~~Histogram Equalization~~
    - Spatial Filtering
    - Spatial Correlation and Convolution
    - Linear Spatial Filters(average, disk, laplacian, log, motion, prewitt, sobel, unsharp).
5. Geometric Transformation and Image Registration
    - Affine Transform
    - Projective Transform
6. Color Image Processing
7. Morphological Image Processing
8. Image Segmentation/Object Detection.
    - Color or shape based object detection.
    - Point, Line, Edge Detect.
    - Region-Based Segmentation.
